# Building and deploying an IBM Maximo Asset Management V7.6 with Feature Pack image to Docker

Maximo on Docker enables to run Maximo Asset Management on Docker. The images are deployed fine-grained services instead of single instance. The following instructions describe how to set up IBM Maximo Asset Management V7.6 Docker images. This images consist of several components e.g. WebSphere, Db2, and Maximo installation program.

## Building IBM Maximo Asset Management V7.6 images by using build tool

Prerequisites: all binaries must be accessible via a web server during building phase.

You can use a tool for building docker images by using the build tool.

Usage:
```
Usage: build.sh [DIR] [OPTION]...

-c | --check            Check required packages
-C | --deepcheck        Check and compare checksum of required packages
-r | --remove           Remove images when an image exists in repository
-d | --check-dir [DIR]  The directory for validating packages (Docker for Windows only)
-h | --help             Show this help text
```

Procedures:
1. Place the downloaded Maximo, IBM Db2, IBM Installation Manager and IBM WebSphere Application Server traditional binaries on a directory.
2. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nishi2go/maximo-docker.git
    ```
3. Move to the directory.
    ```bash
    cd maximo-docker
    ```
4. Run build tool.
   ```bash
   bash build.sh [Image directory] [-c] [-C] [-r]
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   bash build.sh /images -c -r
   ```

   Example for Docker for Windows:
   ```bash
   bash build.sh "C:/images" -c -r -d /images
   ```
   Note 1: This script works on Windows Subsystem on Linux.<br>
   Note 2: md5sum is required. For Mac, install it manually - https://raamdev.com/2008/howto-install-md5sum-sha1sum-on-mac-os-x/
5. Run containers by using the Docker Compose file to create and deploy new instances.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    Note: It will take 3-4 hours (depend on your machine spec) to complete the installation.
    Note: To change the default passwords, edit \[COMPONENT\]_PASSWORD environment variables in docker-compose.yml file. Do not use a different value to the same environment variable across services.
6. Make sure to be accessible to Maximo login page: http://hostname/maximo

## Building IBM Maximo Asset Management V7.6 images by manually

Prerequisites: all binaries must be accessible via a web server during building phase.

Procedures:
1. Place the downloaded Maximo, IBM Db2, IBM Installation Manager and IBM WebSphere Application Server traditional binaries on a directory
2. Create docker network for build with:
    ```bash
    docker network create build
    ```
3. Run nginx docker image to be able to download binaries from HTTP.
    ```bash
    docker run --name images -h images --network build \
    -v [Image directory]:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx
    ```
4. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nishi2go/maximo-docker.git
    ```
5. Move to the directory.
    ```bash
    cd maximo-docker
    ```
6. Build Docker images:
    Build Db2 image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t maximo/db2:11.1.4a -t maximo/db2:latest --network build maxdb
    ```
    Build IBM Enterprise Deployment (IBM Installation Manager) image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t maximo/ibmim:1.8.8 -t maximo/ibmim:latest --network build ibmim
    ```

    ```
    Build Maximo Asset Management Installation image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t maximo/maximo:7.6.1.2 -t maximo/maximo:latest --network build maximo
    ```
    Note: If the build has failed during Maximo Feature Pack installation, run the docker build again.
7. Run containers by using the Docker Compose file to create and deploy new instances.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    Note: It will take 3-4 hours (depend on your machine spec) to complete the installation.
    Note: To change the default passwords, edit \[COMPONENT\]_PASSWORD environment variables in docker-compose.yml file. Do not use a different value to the same environment variable across services.
8. Make sure to be accessible to Maximo login page: http://hostname/maximo

## Building IBM Maximo Asset Management V7.6 images with an Oracle Database Container by using build tool

### Prerequisites:
- All binaries must be accessible via a web server during building phase.
- An Oracle Database containar or any on-premise instance must be prepared before running docker-compose command.
  - Follow the guide from the [repo](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase) to create an Oracle Database container.

Procedures:
1. Place the downloaded Maximo, IBM Db2, IBM Installation Manager and IBM WebSphere Application Server traditional binaries on a directory.
2. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nishi2go/maximo-docker.git
    ```
3. Move to the directory.
    ```bash
    cd maximo-docker
    ```
4. Run build tool.
   ```bash
   bash build.sh [Image directory] [-c] [-C] [-r]
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   bash build.sh /images -c -r
   ```

   Example for Docker for Windows:
   ```bash
   bash build.sh "C:/images" -c -r -d /images
   ```
   Note 1: This script works on Windows Subsystem on Linux.<br>
   Note 2: md5sum is required. For Mac, install it manually - https://raamdev.com/2008/howto-install-md5sum-sha1sum-on-mac-os-x/
5. Run containers by using the Docker Compose file to create and deploy new instances.
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.ora.yml up -d
    ```
    Note: It will take 3-4 hours (depend on your machine spec) to complete the installation.
    Note: To change the default passwords, edit \[COMPONENT\]_PASSWORD environment variables in docker-compose.yml file. Do not use a different value to the same environment variable across services.
6. Make sure to be accessible to Maximo login page: http://hostname/maximo


## Skip the maxinst process in starting up the maxdb container by using Db2 restore command

[Maxinst program](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21314938) supports to initialize and create a Maximo database that called during the "deployConfiguration" process in the Maximo installer. This process is painfully slow because it creates more than thousand tables from scratch. To skip the process, you can use a backup database to restore during first boot time in a maxdb service. So then, it can reduce the creation time for containers from second time.

Procedures:
1. Build container images first (follow above instructions)
2. Move to the cloned directory.
    ```bash
    cd maximo-docker
    ```
3. Make a backup directory.
    ```bash
    mkdir ./backup
    ```
4. Uncomment the following volume configuration in docker-compose.yml.
    ```yaml
      maxdb:
        volumes:
          - type: bind
            source: ./backup
            target: /backup
    ```
5. Run containers by using the Docker Compose file. (follow above instructions)
6. Take a backup from the maxdb service by using a backup tool.
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec maxdb /work/backup.sh maxdb76 /backup
    ```
    Note: Backup image must be only one in the directory. Backup task must fail when more than two images in it.

So that, now you can create the containers from the backup image that is stored in the directory.
